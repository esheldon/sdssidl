Most of the IDL code is written by 
    Erin Sheldon
    Dave Johnston
    Tim Mckay
    Ryan Scranton

With contributions from others as well as direct copies of programs from people
who aren't even aware.  In the latter case the documentation has been left
intact in order to preserve authorship.  All code written by the above authors
is licenced under the Gnu General Public License (see gpl.txt).  Other codes
are licenced in one of the following ways:

    1) According to the license listed in the source code
    2) When no license is shown in the source code the code
    was assumed to be in the public domain. If you see code for which
    this is not the case, let us know.

The following C/C++ routines were partly or wholly authored by someone else and
linked by Erin Sheldon through an interface.  If you see licensing conflicts
let us know.
