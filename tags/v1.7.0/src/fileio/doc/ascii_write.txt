  NAME:
    ascii_write
  
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
    IDL> ascii_write, struct, filename/lun, /append, 
                    /csv, /tab, delimiter=, /bracket_arrays, status=, /help

  PURPOSE:

    Write an IDL structure to an ascii file.  This is about 12 times faster
    than using the built in printf statement for small structure definitions.
    For really big ones, getting the offsets is the bottleneck. For a tsObj
    file its only about 5 times faster.
    
    The default field separator is a tab, but csv or any user-defined
    delimeter character can be used.

    This program is written in C++ and is linked to IDL via the DLM mechanism.

  INPUTS: 
    struct: The structure array to write. 
    file/lun: Filename or file unit. For string file names, the user must 
        expand all ~ or other environment variables.  If the file
	    unit is entered, the file must be opened with the appropriate 
	    keywords:
                 openr, lun, file, /get_lun, /stdio, bufsize=0

  OPTIONAL INPUTS:
    /cvs: Use ',' as the field delimiter. The default delimeter is a tab
        character.
    /tab: Use a tab character as the field delimiter.  This is the default.
    delimiter: The field delimiter.  Only the first character of the
        input string is used. The default is the tab character.
    /append: Append the file.
    /bracket_arrays: {} is placed around array data in each row, with 
        values comma delimited within.  Postgresql databases require
        this format, with a whitespace delimiter for ordinary fields, for
        the COPY command.
    /help: Print this documentation.

  OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
    status=: The status of the read. 0 for success, 1 for read failure, 
             2 for input errors such as bad file unit.
