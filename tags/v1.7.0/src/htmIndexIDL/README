The original documentation for HTM code is below

I had to cut out the cout,cerr, etc commands for
in order to link to IDL with linux. Also changed
endl to "\n" in order to link to IDL in both linux and Alpha.

For OSF had to remove some statements in these .h files:
VarStr.hpp
SpatialGeneral.h


Added functionality to classes SpatialConstraint, 
SpatialConvex, SpatialDomeain: allowed ra,dec,d
to be set without opening a file.

SpatialDomain domain;
domain.setRaDecD(ra,dec,d);

Wrote applications htmLookupRadec.cpp and htmIntersectRadec.cpp
intended for linking.

1. Installation
---------------

We provide makefiles for the platforms Linux, OSF, Solaris, IRIX.
For Windows there is a Visual Studio Workspace file inculded.

Unix:
=====
To make things work, do

make PLATFORM
make

where PLATFORM is one of linux,osf,solaris,irix

and you'll have a working library in lib/ and a couple of example
apps in bin/.  All sources for the example executables are in app/ If
you want to build on a platform other than the four above, please edit
any of the Makefile.PLATFORM in src/ and app/, update it and save it
as Makefile.  Be so kind to send me a copy of that so that I can add
it to the distribution.


Windows:
========
Load SpatialIndex.dsw in Visual Studio and build as usual.
There is a project for the dll as well as for all examples.
You might need to tweak some of the project settings..
