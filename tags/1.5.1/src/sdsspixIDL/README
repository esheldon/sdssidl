Hey Erin...

I've attached my code for the pair counting version of my correlation 
code.  To compile it you'd use something like

gcc calc_wtheta_jack_pair_pixel_bbox.c -lm -O6 -lgsl -lgslcblas -o 
calc_wtheta_jack_pair_pixel_bbox

You also need to make sure that pixel_util.c is in the same directory 
(this file contains all the hierarchical routines that are mirrored in 
IDL).  If you look at the MakeRandomCatalog routine, you'll see how the 
masking is implemented.

Here's the list of pixel routines in /data2/sdss/idl/ryan_idl/:

ang2pix.pro
area_index.pro
display_pixel.pro
downsample.pro
find_subpix.pro
pix2ang.pro
pix_area.pro
pix_bound.pro
resolution_bound.pro
superpix.pro
superpix_bound.pro
upsample.pro

Pretty much all of them have one or more analogs in pixel_util.c

I'll let you know as soon as my data shuffling is finished.

-Ryan
