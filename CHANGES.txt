v1.4.0 2008-09-20
---------------------------------------
Completely revamped the configure system.  Now creates a single file
src/make.conf with the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS needed for the OS.  This is included
in the Makefiles for each module.

Added support for Darwin.  This has been tested on leopard intel core 2 duo.
Need more testing.  Also, postgres and gsl support is currently only for code
installed in one of the "usual places" or via Fink.  



New Files: 
    pro/sdss/sdssidl_test_suite.pro: A suite of tests for the sdssidl distro.  
        Mainly tests the C/C++ extensions
    pro/util/match_hist.pro:  Get a subset ind2 from array2 such that the 
        histogram of array2[ind2] is proportional to that of another 
        array array1
    pro/files/dirsep.pro:  This was left out accidentally in release v1.3.0.  
        A couple of programs depend upon it.
    data/sample-pixel.mask:  A sample sdsspix mask
    data/sample-sphpoly-mask.dat: A sample spherical polygon mask

major changes:
    Reading string fields in csv is now fully supported by the READ_IDLSTRUCT()
    procedure. Previously this was only supported if the ascii_read() C++
    code was linked.

    ascii_read() can now deal properly with variable length strings whenever a
        proper delimiter is used for all fields.  If just white space is used
        the string fields must sill be fixed length.  Added the following
        keywords:
            /tab, delimiter=, /whitespace
        Default is /tab.  The whitespace separated fields is now a special
        case since the specific delimiter is a better model and doesn't
        require fixed length fields.
    pgsql_query().  This C extension for querying Postgresql databases
        now supports reading of multi-dimensional arrays from databases.
    pro/postgres/postgres__define:  Now uses the postgres binary format
        for copying data into tables, as used by struct2table.  This is
        more flexible but not significantly more efficient.  But now all
        IDL native code rather than relying on ascii_write DLM.
        
minor changes:
    pro/files/path_join.pro: More flexible behavior.
    pro/util/match_multi.pro: Check number of matches > 0 before creating 
        output array.
    pro/util/match_dup.pro: Bug fix; code checks for overlapping ranges of
        input arrays.


v1.3.0 2007-10-09
---------------------------------------

New files:
plotting/setfont.pro: Set the font. Currently vector only.
plotting/textoidl.pro: This is a highly modified version of Matt Craig's 
    program.  Most of the mods are by David Schlegel and Doug Finkbeiner.
    I added the \odot symbol and incorporated into sdssidl.
astro/spheredist.pro: Compute spherical distances and angles.  Used to be
    mygcirc.pro

Major Modifications:
plotting/multiplot.pro:
    Can now place titles on the overall x and y axes, as well as a top title
    using these new keywords. 
      mtitle=mtitle, mTitSize=mTitSize, mTitOffset=mTitOffset, $
      mxTitle=mxTitle, mxTitSize=mxTitSize, mxTitOffset=mxTitOffset, $
      myTitle=myTitle, myitSize=myitSize, myitOffset=myitOffset
    Can now control gaps between the plots with the gap=, xgap=, and ygap=
    keywords
plotting/setupplot.pro:
    For vector fonts, now calls setfont with the index from
    !pslayout.font_index (which was unused before).
plotting/pslayout.pro:
    Not defaults to vector fonts, font_index=6, which results in much
    nicer fonts and works better with the textoidl() program.

sdss/read_objmask.pro:
    rerun,camcol,field,parent now included in objmask. This is done by the
    C code when the object has an atlas image.  If it doesn't, the id info
    is added by this IDL wrapper.
util/match_multi.pro:
    Two new optional outputs: 
   match1: The array of match indices from array 1.  This may not be the same
       length as the match array for array 2.  See dupmatch1 for that.
   dupmatch1: An array of matches from array 1 that correspond direclty
       to all matches from array2, so it may contain duplicates.
fileio/read_struct.pro: 
    Can now read multiple files.  More self-sufficient method for determining 
    number of lines, but for idl < 5.6 is unix only.

Minor Modifications:
ascii_read() DLM: Fixed documentation error stating that string columns
    could be variable length.

v1.2 2007-05-09
---------------------------------------

New files:
statistics/bootstrap.pro
    Create bootstrap samples and calculate statistics for input variables.
    The input data are up to 8 equal length arrays where each element 
    represents information about the same event or object. For example they
    could be the flux in different wavelenghts of some astronomical object,
    or parameters of an event in a detector.
statistics/boot_indices.pro
    Returns random indices between 0 and imax-1 drawn with replacement for use 
    in bootstrapping.
statistics/boot_samples.pro
    Create bootstrap data for input variables. The input data are up to 
    8 equal length arrays where each element represents information about 
    the same event or object. For example they could be the flux in different 
    wavelenghts of some astronomical object, or parameters of an event in a 
    detector. The output is the mean of each bootstrap sample, for each input
    variable, in an [nsample, nvar] array, or 1-d for nvar=1.  
statistics/boot_stats.pro
    Calculate the statistics (mean, sdev, covariance) for a set of bootstrap samples. 
    This program does not create bootstrap samples, see boot_indices() and 
    boot_samples() for that.  The input data are a 1-d array of bootstrap samples
    or a 2-d [nsample, nvar] array with the second dimension representing the value
    of different variables for each bootstrap sample.
statistics/boot_hist.pro
    Create a histogram with bootstrapped errors.

Major Modifications:
files/ddir.pro and dfile.pro
    Major re-write to take an array of path elements instead of different
    parameters as the path elements. Much more flexible.
plotting/plothist
    Allow bootstrapping using the nboot keyword. Calls boot_hist in
        this case.  Can use /error to plot poisson errors on unweighted
        histograms.  2006-04-24 Erin Sheldon, NYU

Minor Modifications:
statistics/binner.pro
    Calculate xlow,xhigh stats when binning by number
sdss/sdss_read.pro (sdss_files__define.pro): Bug where the /all flag was
    not being used.
sdss/many files: error in docs saying status of 1 is success, 0 failure, when
    actually the opposite is true.

Other:
Moved statistics related programs into the statistics subdirectory.

Comments:
This is the final version used in the maxbcg lensing analysis from 2007.
 
v1.1a 2007-04-23
---------------------------------------
Bug fix in ddir.pro

v1.1 2007-04-22
---------------------------------------
New files:
pro/util/binner.pro
    Generic binning routine.  Bins 1- or 2-d data sets and supports weighted
    histograms and binning into groups with N elements.  For 1-d it generates 
    histograms, returning info about bin edges and centers and allowing weighted 
    histograms.  For 2-d the data are binned by x and the y values are averaged in 
    each bin using a specified method.  NOTE for 2-d, bins containing no objects 
    are not returned in the result.  The result is a structure containing the
    relevant information.    
pro/files/path_join.pro
    Join path elements using the default path separator, such as directory and
    filenames.
pro/files/ddir.pro
    Generate a directory name based upon input elements.  Combined with dfile
    defines a generic naming scheme for directories and files.
pro/files/dfile.pro
    Create a generic filename based upon the directory structure.  Combined
    with ddir defines a generic naming scheme for directories and files.
pro/sdss/nmgy2lups.pro: 
    Convert flux in nanomaggies to asinh mags, or luptitudes. 
pro/sdss/lups2nmgy.pro: 
    Convert asinh mags, or luptitudes, to flux in nanomaggies.
